### 2024-12-19: Removed ChromaDB and Updated GeminiService to Work Without RAG

**Problem**: The system was using ChromaDB for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) which added complexity and dependencies without providing significant value for the current use case.

**Solution**: 
- Removed ChromaDB service and all related dependencies
- Updated GeminiService to work directly with Gemini API without RAG
- Simplified question generation workflow to use only manual context input
- Removed ChromaDB from all Docker configurations
- Updated all routes and services to remove ChromaDB dependencies
- Updated documentation to reflect the simplified architecture

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/services/GeminiService.ts` - Removed ChromaService dependency and RAG functionality
- `backend/src/services/ChromaService.ts` - Deleted entire file
- `backend/src/routes/file-upload.ts` - Removed ChromaDB integration
- `backend/src/routes/question-management.ts` - Removed ChromaDB endpoints
- `backend/package.json` - Removed ChromaDB dependencies
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed ChromaDB service and volumes
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Removed ChromaDB service and volumes
- `docker-compose.test.yml` - Removed ChromaDB service and volumes
- `docs/design.md` - Updated architecture documentation
- `chroma/` directory - Removed entire directory

**Result**: Simplified architecture with direct Gemini API integration, reduced complexity, and fewer dependencies while maintaining all core functionality.

### 2024-12-19: Fixed npm scripts referencing non-existent testing directory

**Problem**: Many npm scripts in the root `package.json` were trying to access a `testing` directory that doesn't exist, causing errors when running `npm run` commands.

**Root Cause**: The testing functionality was moved to individual `frontend` and `backend` directories, but the root `package.json` still contained scripts that referenced the old `testing` directory structure.

**Solution**: 
- Updated root `package.json` to remove scripts that reference the non-existent `testing` directory
- Replaced broken scripts with working ones that point to the correct locations:
  - `test:unit` now runs tests in both frontend and backend
  - `test:e2e` now runs frontend e2e tests
  - `test:integration` now runs integration tests in both frontend and backend
  - Added individual scripts for frontend and backend testing
- Removed `testing` from the workspaces array
- Updated `install:all` script to only install frontend and backend dependencies

**Files Modified**:
- `package.json` - Updated scripts and workspaces

**Result**: All npm scripts now work correctly without trying to access non-existent directories. The scripts now properly delegate to the individual frontend and backend test configurations.

## Pending Tasks

### Test Configuration Issues
- Frontend tests have TypeScript configuration issues that need to be resolved
- Backend tests have Jest configuration issues with regex patterns that need to be fixed
- These are separate from the original npm script issue and should be addressed as separate tasks

## Completed Tasks

### 2024-12-19: Fixed Docker Container Permission Issues and TypeScript Syntax Errors

**Problem**: 
1. Docker containers were failing with permission denied errors when trying to write to mounted volumes
2. TypeScript compilation errors in `backend/src/routes/file-upload.ts` due to syntax issues

**Root Cause**: 
1. Containers run as non-root user (nodejs:nodejs, UID 1001) but mounted volumes were owned by host user (UID 1000)
2. Orphaned object literal in file-upload.ts causing syntax errors

**Solution**: 
1. Created `fix-permissions.sh` script to set correct ownership for all mounted volumes
2. Fixed TypeScript syntax errors in file-upload.ts by removing orphaned object literal
3. Script creates necessary directories and sets proper permissions (755) for all container-accessible paths

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/routes/file-upload.ts` - Fixed syntax errors by removing orphaned object literal
- `fix-permissions.sh` - Created new script to fix Docker permission issues

**Result**: 
- Docker containers can now write to mounted volumes without permission errors
- TypeScript compilation succeeds without syntax errors
- All necessary directories are created with proper permissions for container access
