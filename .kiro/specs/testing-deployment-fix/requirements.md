# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Learn2Play platform currently has a fragmented testing structure and deployment configuration that makes it difficult to run tests reliably and deploy the application consistently. This feature aims to consolidate and fix the testing infrastructure, create a unified deployment strategy, and ensure that all tests pass before deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Testing Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent and reliable testing structure across frontend and backend, so that I can run tests efficiently and trust the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `npm test` in either frontend or backend THEN the system SHALL execute all relevant tests with consistent configuration
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear, structured output with proper error reporting
3. WHEN I run tests in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL use the same configuration as local development
4. WHEN test files are missing or misconfigured THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating what needs to be fixed
5. IF a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information about the failure location and cause

### Requirement 2: Test Environment Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want isolated and reproducible test environments, so that tests don't interfere with each other and produce consistent results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL use isolated test databases and services
2. WHEN multiple test suites run concurrently THEN the system SHALL prevent conflicts between test environments
3. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL clean up test data and resources automatically
4. WHEN test environment setup fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery instructions
5. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults or fail with clear instructions

### Requirement 3: Test Coverage and Reporting

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage reporting, so that I can identify untested code and maintain quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate coverage reports in multiple formats (HTML, LCOV, JSON)
2. WHEN coverage is below threshold THEN the system SHALL fail the test run with clear messaging
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL exclude test files, configuration files, and build artifacts from coverage
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL be accessible via web browser for detailed analysis
5. IF coverage data is corrupted THEN the system SHALL regenerate reports or fail gracefully

### Requirement 4: Deployment Pipeline Integration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want deployment to only succeed when all tests pass, so that we maintain code quality in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment is initiated THEN the system SHALL run the complete test suite first
2. WHEN any test fails THEN the system SHALL prevent deployment and provide detailed failure information
3. WHEN tests pass THEN the system SHALL proceed with building and deploying the application
4. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL run smoke tests against the deployed environment
5. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and detailed error logs

### Requirement 5: Docker-based Testing and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want containerized testing and deployment environments, so that I can ensure consistency across development, testing, and production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use Docker containers for database and external services
2. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use the same container images that were tested
3. WHEN containers start THEN the system SHALL wait for health checks before proceeding
4. WHEN services fail health checks THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and clear error reporting
5. IF container builds fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed build logs and suggested fixes

### Requirement 6: Performance and Load Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated performance testing, so that I can catch performance regressions before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN the system SHALL measure response times, memory usage, and throughput
2. WHEN performance metrics exceed thresholds THEN the system SHALL fail the test run with detailed metrics
3. WHEN load testing THEN the system SHALL simulate realistic user scenarios and concurrent usage
4. WHEN performance tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports comparing against baseline metrics
5. IF performance tests are unstable THEN the system SHALL provide retry mechanisms and statistical analysis

### Requirement 7: End-to-End Test Automation

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want reliable end-to-end tests that validate complete user workflows, so that I can ensure the application works correctly from a user perspective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN E2E tests run THEN the system SHALL start complete application stack in test mode
2. WHEN user workflows are tested THEN the system SHALL simulate real browser interactions and validate results
3. WHEN E2E tests fail THEN the system SHALL capture screenshots, videos, and detailed logs
4. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate reports with visual evidence of test execution
5. IF browser automation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with different browser configurations and provide debugging information

### Requirement 8: Complete Test File Integration and Infrastructure Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files in the repository to be properly integrated with the unified testing configuration and remove redundant test infrastructure, so that I have a clean, consistent testing environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the testing system scans the repository THEN it SHALL discover and integrate every test file (.test.*, .spec.*) into the unified configuration
2. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL run all discovered test files using the appropriate test runner configuration
3. WHEN test files are missing from configuration THEN the system SHALL provide clear warnings and automatically include them
4. WHEN redundant test infrastructure exists THEN the system SHALL remove duplicate configurations, scripts, and directories
5. IF test files cannot be integrated THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and suggested fixes
